				<h4>Day 19</h4>

                <p>So today I tried completing a pull request on GitHub for the first time! How'd it go you ask? TERRIBLY. Lord beer me strength because I'm going to have to study up on GitHub. I'm not big on going all "yay me!", I'd prefer to be modest, but I have to say I'm proud of myself for even reaching out to people on Twitter asking how to complete what I was looking for, and for asking questions. I was never big on participation in college because of this. Usually because people are mean if you have the wrong answer or you simply say "I don't know." I feel like people need to be more courteous of this. It's so hard to admit that I don't know something because I feel so stupid. Everyone was so nice and supportive about trying to complete this but I still beat myself up in my head about not knowing this.<br>
                    This leads me to something else. I think I'm going to have to decline this onsite bootcamp I was looking into and I hate that this is the choice I'm going with. Which probably makes you think, why don't I just go with the other option then? Because I wouldn't have peace going down that road either. The thing is is that it's $11,900 after taking off the grant and scholarship I'd get. Great because it's cheaper than going and getting my master's in something and would take less time but still expensive. I wouldn't be able to afford paying off a loan with an 8-10% interest rate. So I guess I'm doing the self taught route for now but I keep having this internal conversation that I'm never going to get that dev job. I attended the interview this past Saturday for the Jr. Software Developer job and I felt it went so horribly. Mainly because I didn't know what to expect. So in my head I think a bootcamp would help prep me for this. It would help me network and I'd have more support than doing self taught but I just don't have the money.<br>
                    Anyways - if you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I'm going to put some time into JS in Colt Steele's bootcamp for now. Have any thoughts or comments? Drop me a line on twitter! Click the link above and say hi!<br>
